# Description
This python challenge is made up of two smaller challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. In the PyBank challenge I'm tasked with analysing the financial records of a company to calculate (1) the total months, (2) net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, (3) changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the (4) average of those changes; as well as the greatest increase and decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Usage
-Contained in this python_challenge repo are 2 separate folders for PyBank and PyPoll datasets

-PyBank folder contains: (1) Analysis folder that stores the txt file that has the results from my analysis and a Terminal screenshot that displays the same results, (2) Resources folder that stores the budget_data.csv, (3) main.py file that contains my code for budget_data.csv

-PyPoll folder contains (1) Analysis folder that stores the txt file that has the results from my analysis and a Terminal screenshot that displays the same results, (2) Resources folder that stores the election_data.csv, (3) main_PyPoll.py file that contains my code for election_data.csv

To see the results, navigate to the Analysis folder. To see the code, navigate to either main.py (for PyBank dataset) or main_PyPoll.py (for PyPoll dataset).
