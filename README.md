# Description
This python challenge is made up of two smaller challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. In the PyBank challenge I'm tasked with analysing the financial records of a company to calculate (1) the total months, (2) net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, (3) changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the (4) average of those changes; as well as the greatest increase and decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Usage
-Contained in this python_challenge repo are 2 separate folders for PyBank and PyPoll datasets.

-PyBank folder contains: (1) Analysis folder that stores the txt file that has the results from my analysis and a Terminal screenshot that displays the same results, (2) Resources folder that stores the budget_data.csv, (3) main.py file that contains my code for budget_data.csv.

-PyPoll folder contains (1) Analysis folder that stores the txt file that has the results from my analysis and a Terminal screenshot that displays the same results, (2) Resources folder that stores the election_data.csv, (3) main_PyPoll.py file that contains my code for election_data.csv.

To see the results, navigate to the Analysis folder. To see the code, navigate to either main.py (for PyBank dataset) or main_PyPoll.py (for PyPoll dataset). 

## Installations:
The following have been installed for this project:
1. `Python`
2. `VSCode`

### Budget data analysis
In this section, I created a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The current dataset is large and containing the following columns:
1. `Date`
2. `Profit/Losses`

The results are summarised in the image below:

### Poll data analysis
In this section, I'm tasked with helping a small, rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process. The dataset I used for this section  is composed of three columns: 
1. `Voter ID`
2. `County`
3. `Candidate`

I created a Python script that analyses the votes and calculates each of the following values:

1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

The results are summarised in the image below:
